# internet-book-database
An app that connects with Google Books API in order to have a profile and save books to it.

## Description

I was motivated to create this app as a means to continue working with the MERN stack. I wanted to practice more with mutations, resolvers and typedefs. The biggest learning experience here for me was making sure my files lined up correctly with naming conventions and how mutations, etc were being passed through.

## Installation
